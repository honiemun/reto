### Retool
This is the Github repository for **Retool**, the codename for the v2 rewrite of the Reto Discord bot. The old version is available on [this repo](https://github.com/honiemun/reto-legacy).

Currently, Retool is **closed source**. This may change in the future.

### Installation
Clone to your local machine, install all dependencies using `npm i .` and run the development version with `npm run dev`.

You may need to create a `.env` file with your [app token and secret](https://discord.com/developers/applications), along with other optional features.

### Invite links
